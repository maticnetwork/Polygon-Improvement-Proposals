## Polygon Improvement Proposals (PIPs)

**Before you initiate a pull request**, please read the [PIP-1](https://github.com/hrook1/Polygon-Improvement-Proposals/blob/main/PIPs/PIP%20-1%20.md) process document. Ideas should be thoroughly discussed on the [Polygon Community Forum](https://forum.polygon.technology/) first.
If your proposal is discussing a new contract standard, make sure you submit it under the [Polygon Request for Comment (PRC) folder](https://github.com/hrook1/Polygon-Improvement-Proposals/tree/main/PIP/PRC).
For more information on the processes and the PIP format, visit the [How to PIP.md](https://github.com/hrook1/Polygon-Improvement-Proposals/blob/main/How%20to%20PIP.md)

This repository tracks ongoing improvements to the Polygon Polygon protocols. It contains:

- The [process document](https://forum.polygon.technology/) that governs how protocol changes are published.
- The successfully submitted PIPs.
- The [PRC folder](https://github.com/hrook1/Polygon-Improvement-Proposals/tree/main/PIP/PRC), which, similarly to the "Ethereum Request for Comment" (ERC), is dedicated to PIP proposals that discuss token standards.
- The Project Management of the PIPs process and the Builders Meetings (read below).

### Mission

In a decentralized and self-governed system, a framework is necessary for the developer community to inform, propose, and gather technical feedback on new features.

By introducing a transparent and versioned repository, the community maintains a historical record of all feature proposals, including their revision history and implementation progress.

### Preferred Citation Format

Consider any document not published by the PIP repository as a working paper. Additionally, consider published PIPs with a status of "draft", "review", or "last call" to be incomplete drafts, and note that their specification is likely to be subject to change.

## Project Management

### Purpose

The Polygon Builders' meeting is a technical call intended to bring together various Polygon Labs' developers like those on the Governance, Validator support, PoS, and Research teams with the broader Polygon community to provide updates on their projects, discuss various PIPs to improve the protocols and support each other as we build Web 3.0.
The calls are transcribed and recorded and will be available immediately after the meetings conclude.

### Agenda

The agenda for the meetings are hosted under the Project Management folder. Please send a pull request to the open agenda, mentioning the topic you want to discuss and linking any relevant materials (PIPs, prototypes, etc.)

Anyone is welcome to add an item to the agenda as long as it follows the following guidelines:

- The topic is technical in nature.
- The topic involves the Polygon protocols at a low level. This means that specific Dapps are generally not allowed as topics.
- The topic should not be philosophical. The Builders' meetings are not meant to decide contentious philosophical issues that the community should decide. There are exceptions to this, but generally, these topics distract from more productive technical discussion.

### Who Can Attend

Core Protocol developers, Polygon Labs Researchers, PoS validators, and the dApp and ecosystem community members are invited to attend the meetings.
