# Writing a PIP might look like a big deal, but it really isn’t! 

Actually it is a really easy and rewarding experience as long as you follow the suggested PIP  format and some basic rules! Or better, just ask yourself: 

_Is it a PIP or a promotion?_

* Do not use the PIP framework to promote your project! 

_Is this proposal unique?_

* Make sure that your proposed PIP is not a duplicate of a previous proposal.

_Why are you writing a PIP?_


* Ideally, the reason would be to standardize something, implement a change to the existing smart contracts or a change to the protocol itself.

_Does your PIP have a single implementation or a broader scope?_


* If your PIP has a single implementation, it probably shouldn’t be a PIP. 

### OK, I have checked the PIP framework, and consulted with the above questions. What now?

A Polygon Improvement Proposal (PIP) is a design document that proposes new features, improvements, or standards for the Polygon products. The following is a guide on how to write and submit a PIP:

   1. **Choose a topic**: Choose a topic that you want to propose a change for. It could be a new feature, an improvement, or a standard.

   2. **Research and gather information**: Gather information about the topic, including relevant background information, technical details, and any relevant existing solutions or standards.

   3. **Write the PIP**: Write the PIP using a template provided by the Polygon community. The template includes sections for introduction, motivation, specification, and rationale.

   4. Gather feedback: Share your PIP with the Polygon community and get feedback from experts, developers, and users. You can do this by sharing the PIP on forums, social media, or by reaching out to relevant individuals.

   5. **Revise and finalize**: Revise your PIP based on the feedback you receive and finalize it.

   6. **Submit the PIP**: Submit the PIP to the Polygon Improvement Proposal repository on Github.

   7. **Community review**: The Polygon community will review the PIP and provide feedback. You may need to revise the PIP based on the feedback received.

   8. **Approval**: If the PIP is approved, it will be included in the Polygon protocol.

## Polygon Improvent Proposal (PIP) vs Polygon Request for Comments (PRC)

Polygon Improvent Proposal (PIP) and Polygon Request for Comments (PRC) are similar in that they both serve as a standard for proposing improvements and additions to the Polygon products. However, there is a subtle difference in the scope of the proposals they represent.

PIPs are broader in scope and can encompass proposals for improvements to the Polygon products, such as changes to the protocol, upgrades to the blockchain, and new features.

PRC, on the other hand, is focused specifically on proposals for standardizing smart contracts on the Polygon products. PRCs outline proposed standards fro smart contracts development and deployment, such as token standards, and provide a common framework for developers to build upon. 

In summary, PIPs are for proposals that aim to improve the Polygon products as a whole, while PRCs are for proposals that aim sto standardize smart contract development on Polygon products. 

#### !Remember! The PIP Editors will work with you to make sure that your proposal meets the PIP standard and that is formatted correctly.

Note: The Polygon community has a rigorous review process for PIPs and not all proposals will be accepted. It's important to write a well-researched and thoroughly thought out proposal to increase its chances of being accepted.

### Here are some tips that will help you with moving the PIP forward! 

* Use the Polygon Forum to engage with the Community. 
* Reach out to projects that are relevant to your proposal and ask them for feedback and ideas! 
* Tip: Under the Verified Group in the Polygon Forum you will find a wide range of Ecosystem Partners and Dapps. 
* White an article about the relevance of the PIP, explain your rational, inspiration and how it can be used to improve the protocol/community. 
* Engage in the discussion taking place in the Forum- Great minds work better together!
